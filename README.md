# Motivation
To satisfy the demands of 5G systems, there is a tendency to Network Functions Virtualization
(NFV) and Software Defined Networks (SDN). The integration of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) in this paradigms, such as C-RAN, will make use of Artificial Intelligence
techniques to make short time scale predictions of UE SNR levels, among other
channel state parameters. However, it can be challenging to properly train the AI models
without sufficiently large and representative datasets. This work analyzes how to
enlarge said datasets through advanced learning techniques, allowing an optimal analysis
of the SNR properties even when the available samples are much lower than the real
ones, eventually leading to more scalable algorithms.

It is also possible to extrapolate this work to other fields as the [Data Generation](#data-generation) part is general for any time series (with an appropriate hyperparameters tuning).
